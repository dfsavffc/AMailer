---

Backend-py3 is a framework for writing microservices in Python. It provides standardized infrastructure that facilitates development, testing, and deployment of Python microservices.

## Repository Structure

The backend-py3 repository has the following main structure:

- **services/** - Main directory containing microservice code
  - Each microservice is located in a separate subdirectory
  - Each service has its own configuration file `service.yaml`
- **libraries/** - Shared libraries used by multiple services
  - Reusable components are placed here
  - When creating new shared code, it's preferred to place it here
- **taxi/** - Common code for all services in the base framework
  - Existing code not intended for extension
  - Includes core framework components
- **plugins/** - Plugins for the code generation system
  - Extensions for automatic code creation

## Architectural Principles

Backend-py3 adheres to the following key principles:

1. **Microservices Architecture** - Each service performs a specific business function
2. **Code Generation** - Automatic creation of client and server code from specifications
